Version 1.1
   Added: Gbasic copy format support. Palette data is saved in an ascii file if needed.

Version 1.02
   Added: dos2 check

Version 1.01
   BugFix: Fixed error in data size calculating while saving g9b files

Version 1.00
   Added G9B file format
   Added palette in ascii output when saving raw pictures

Version 0.95
    Bugfix:In 16bit mode pictures with an odd width resolution where displayed
	   incorrectly.

Version 0.94
    Added YUV mode support.
    Improved read block size routine.
    Improved YJK mode viewing a bit. 		

Version 0.93

   Added RAW save option. If a BMP named PICTURE.BMP than the RAW file will be called PICTURE.RAW.
   This file will be saved on the drive and directory where you started V9BMP from.

Version 0.92

    Added 8 bit palette mode support for 8 bit BMP pictures. Only the first 64
    colors will be used, because the V9990 only support 64 colors in palette 
    mode.

Version 0.91

    Implanted TIM support. This is a picture format of the PSX.
    It doesn't support the pallet mode of this format.

Version 0.9

   Implanted YJK mode for viewing 24 Bit pictures. I will implant YUV in a
   later version.  Add some extra display information while viewing pictures.
   CAUTION: Sometimes the pictures are corrupt when viewing them in YJK
   mode, because the resolution of a pictures most be dividable by 4.

Version 0.81

   You can abort viewing by holding down the Esc key now.

Version 0.80

   Improved 24 bit BMP convert routine (again), it's 21% faster now!!!!.
   Improved 1 bit BMP convert routine, just a little bit faster.


Version 0.70
   
  Added Manual screen select. You can select X resolution between 192 and 1024 and 
  Interlace on/off.
  
  Improved some code.  


Version 0.60

  V9BMP centers the picture, but now it is also possible to shift it to 
  right/left and/or up/down. 


Version 0.51

  Scan option is now available. You will see the file info only
  
  Improved command line read routine. It makes no errors anymore (I hope).

  OS/2 bitmaps are skipped now. I will not implant OS/2 bmp, because this format
  is rarely used.
 
Version 0.50

  Implanted file info. Now you see the file name and resolution of a BMP
  file on the V9938/V9958.


Version 0.42

 1 BIT bmp is also 100% okay now.

 I tested V9BMP with more than 300MB of BMP files and no errors occurred.
 If you have a picture that is incorrect converted, than send me that picture
 and I will correct V9BMP.



Version 0.40

 4 BIT bmp is now 100% ok.
 1 BIT bmp is now supported too, only is not ok yet.


Version 0.35

The header block load routine loaded 1 byte to much this resulted in shifting
the picture to the right.

Improved 24 bit BMP convert routine, it's a little bit faster now.

V9BMP checks now for 4 bit RLE and skips them (8 bit RLE is now skipped to).

De back ground color is now forced to black.


Version 0.33

It supports:

24 BIT bmp
 8 BIT bmp
 4 BIT bmp (Not 100 %okay yet, mainly because of the 32 bit padding of the BMP
	   format)

Full DOS2.XX path and wildcard support (It doesn't even work in DOS 1.XX)

At has clipping ,it will select the middle of a picture if the picture is
bigger than the screen and it will center the picture in the middle of then 
screen if the picture is smaller than the screen.

An internal help function, now you will only see how to use the timer function.

V9BMP will select the best resolution for the picture to fit in the screen.


It will support in the future:

 8 BIT (RLE) BMP (there is already a bit of 8 bit RLE support in this version
		  but don't try it, because you will see shit on the screen)
 4 BIT (RLE) BMP		 
 1 BIT BMP  

Screen mode selection, at this moment V9BMP selects its own resolution, but it will
be possible to select your own resolution in a latter version.

File information, this I will make so that you can see the resolution of the picture
and of the screen mode and the file name (and some other things that will pop
up in my mind) on the v9938/58.

I'm thinking about implanting a menu , but I’m not sure yet.
